instructions = The game is presented as a grid of incrementally numbered boxes. The goal\n\
is to reach the final box (Finish) before the opponent, beginning with a\n\
pawn placed on the starting box (Start) and traveling the boxes in ascending\n\
order of numbers. Each player has to roll the dice once per turn and continue\n\
the route according to the number appeared. If a player's pawn is stopped on\n\
a box in which the image of a ladder begins, the pawn must climb the ladder\n\
up until its end, then pass the turn to the opponent. Instead, if a player's\n\
pawn is stopped on a box depicting the head of a snake, it's obliged to go\n\
down the snake positioning itself on the lower numbered box on which the\n\
animal's tail is located.
