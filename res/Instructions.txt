The game is presented as a grid of incrementally numbered boxes that starts 
with 0 and ends with 100. The goal is to reach, beginning with a pawn placed 
on the starting box (box number 0), the final box (box number 100) before 
your opponent. Each player must roll the dice once per turn and continue the 
route according to the number appeared. If a player's pawn is stopped on a 
box in which the image of a ladder begins, the player's pawn must climb the 
ladder up until its end, then pass the turn to his opponent. Instead, if a 
player's pawn is stopped on a box depicting the head of a snake, it's obliged 
to go down the snake positioning itself on the lower numbered box on which 
the animal's tail is located.
