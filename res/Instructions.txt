The game is presented as a grid of incrementally numbered boxes that starts with 0 and ends with 100.
The goal is to reach, beginning with a pawn placed on the starting box (box number 0), the final box 
(box number 100) before your opponent. Each player must roll the dice once per turn and continue the 
route according to the number appeared. If a player's pawn is stopped on a box in which the image of a 
ladder begins, the player's pawn must climb the ladder up until its end before passing the turn to his opponent. 
Instead, if a player's pawn is stopped on a box depicting the head of a snake, it's obliged to go 
down the snake positioning itself on the lower numbered box on which the animal's tail is located.
