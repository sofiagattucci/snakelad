The game is presented as a grid of incrementally numbered boxes. The goal is 
to reach the final box (Finish) before the opponent, beginning with a pawn 
placed on the starting box (Start) and traveling the boxes in ascending order 
of numbers. Each player has to roll the dice once per turn and continue the 
route according to the number appeared. If a player's pawn is stopped on a 
box in which the image of a ladder begins, the pawn must climb the ladder up 
until its end, then pass the turn to the opponent. Instead, if a player's 
pawn is stopped on a box depicting the head of a snake, it's obliged to go 
down the snake positioning itself on the lower numbered box on which the 
animal's tail is located.
